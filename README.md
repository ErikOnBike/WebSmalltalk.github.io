# Web Smalltalk

Web Smalltalk is an initiative that aims at gathering projects \
related to the Smalltalk language and the World Wide Web.

With Smalltalk Web frameworks, you can develop cour code in Smalltalk \
and run it in (browsers, Electron, etc.) or in the back-end (Node.js, etc.).

Currently the following frameworks are included, but more are welcome:\
[CodeParadise](https://github.com/ErikOnBike/CodeParadise),
[PharoJS](https://pharojs.org) including [WebST](https://github.com/WebSmalltalk) and
[SmallJS](https://small-js.org).

## Use Cases

The file [UseCases.md](UseCases.md) describes typical use cases per framework.

## Features

The file [Features.md](Features.md) compares features of the frameworks.
